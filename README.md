# Ai4Trader Downloader
Python script to crawl ai4trader and download both balances and portfolio info. All credit to the boys over at https://ai4trade.ai/ and @HKUDS.

## Setup
Download all the necessary modules, such as Pandas and Playwright, from pip. 

## Editing the script
Go into the file, and in all areas in which it has a path, just rename it to the path that you want. I might update it to make it easier later on.

## Running the script
After this, go and run the script, and both the combined CSV and the individual CSVs will show up in your folder that you selected.
